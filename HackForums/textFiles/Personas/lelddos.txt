LelDDoS Group
Connections and Members:
Christopher “CJ” Sculti
Paras Jha // Anna_Senpai

This group was connected with Anna_Senpai, and used the Mirai Botnet to knock down several big name Minecraft servers, for the
purpose of extortion or, as Reddit user LelDDoS says, “We are trying to prove that when a corporation goes against a community of
ddosers, hackers, and sysadmins, that it doesnt end well for the corporation.” This is one of the crucial links in the Krebs report
that lead Brian to Anna_Senpai’s identity. Christopher “CJ” Sculti was a member of lelddos alongside Anna_Senpai, and helped with
many of the attacks.
