CODE OF CONDUCT
Odin's Library

Written: way too late, 27 June 2017



The honest truth is, The Library was written for fun.

I already had a hardcopy repository of known threat actors, just research I had done during my
independent studies. I decided at some point to virtualize it. This is when is was not even remotely ambitious, and much smaller in size than it is now. It's infinitely smaller than I plan for it to be. 

After I virtualized it, I decided to put it on Git to make it easier for me to access and modify the information in the field. The honest truth is, I wanted to make it private, but I didn't want to have to pay for a private repo. So I made it public, pushed it to github, and kept updating it.

That's when I saw the potential for this project. 

A library of our historic actors, our heroes and villains. These are our aspirations and our nightmares in cyber space. This is record of when a hobby turned into a nation state capability. We have history books about wars that have no bearing on our daily lives, about old and dead men that have long sense rotted in their grave. We of the information era, though, live on, and will long outlive ourselves through our reputation and our data. That's what The Library is for, to 
immortalize the big and the small, those deserving of praise... and Hack Forums. 

The Code of Conduct for The Library is as follows: 

Use it however you want. 

You can hack my account... I'd rather you not, as I obviously have multiple backups and my dox aren't going to be very useful.

I'd like you to contact me with revisions, concerns, and things you'd like to add to The Library. Make pull requests with your data and I will give you whatever recognition you'd like.

This is a library. Any information found in a library should never come back to the author if the reader uses the information therein for evil. I am leveraging open source intelligence (OSINT), so good luck trying to report me for doxing.



Thank you for your readership, and I hope that, in some way, this information is found to be useful and/or entertaining.
