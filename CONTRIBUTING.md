Contribute to The Library by emailing me at the.old.odin.crow@gmail.com or making a pull request. You can also message me on
Twitter at https://twitter.com/0dins_Cr0w (@Odins_Cr0w). I'm working on getting some more secure means of communication for 
privacy reasons, but those should do for now. 

Any contribution to The Library will receive any appropriate requested credit. I do not and will not monetarily pay for information.
I don't have the means or the need to, people are perfectly willing to give it away anyways. 

Thanks always, and keep reading.
