The Library

This is the library. It's to be regarded as an open source collection of information regarding threat actors across
a wide spectrum of industries, backgrounds, and levels of complexities. More than anything, The Library is an 
investigator's journal detailing everything I find while researching the well known and obscure cyber threat actors.

The information is divided into folders that are named by the threat actor, text files so that the information can 
be read without downloading any files, and Personas, containing files about specific Personas within criminal 
organizations or forums. This allows for a top-down approach to the larger organizations as well as a bottom up 
approach to the individuals involved in the organizations. 

Right now, there is an open file on the following threat actors:

1. Anonymous
2. APT1
3. Darkode Hacking Forum / Market
4. Guccifer
5. Guccifer 2.0
6. HackForums Hacking Forum / Market
7. Red Hacker Army // Hacker's Union of China // Red Hacker Alliance

I plan to open up a file on the following threat actors:

1. Blackshades RAT group
2. Zeus Malware group
3. Dancing Bear 
4. Sabu
5. WauchulaGhost
6. th3je5t3r
